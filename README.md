Learning Ansible
----------------
Project to go through some 'hello world' activities with Ansible and by nature, Vagrant.

If you find value in great!  Everything here is was found in some fashion on the internet so nothing special here.

You may question "why the ansible Vagrant box?"   I'm on Windows, so in order to run ansible as the controller (versus target), I have to have a Linux box to run it in that shares the same network as the targets I'll be making updates to.
